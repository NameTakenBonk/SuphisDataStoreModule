If you have a version that goes up like this for e.g 1.2 -> 1.3 then you are safe to upgrade it without breaking your current scripts. But if your version goes up like this 1.2 -> 2.0 then you will probably have to edit the scripts that use the module. You don\'t have to update it but it will depreacate your old version as that version of the module is not being worked on.
