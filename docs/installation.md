# Downloading

Downloading this module is really simple. Simply add the module to your game from these option:

## Github
You can go to the release and get the roblox file from there. [Here](https://github.com/NameTakenBonk/SuphisDataStoreModule/releases)

# Updating your module

If you want to update your module you can check the version on the script in the attributes tab and compare it to the one you have. If you have a version that goes up like this for e.g `1.2 -> 1.3` then you are safe to upgrade it without breaking your current scripts. But if your version goes up like this `1.2 -> 2.0` then you will probably have to edit the scripts that use the module. You don't have to update it but it will depreacate your old version as that version of the module is not being worked on. If you want to see the full code changes or the update log of the versions you can either check the discord or go to this link right here: https://github.com/NameTakenBonk/SuphisDataStoreModule/releases 


If you want to get the old version back all the older versions are saved on the github release page with the same link provieded here.
